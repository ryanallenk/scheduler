# Interview Scheduler
Scheduler is a modern client application built using the React view library that allows users to book and manage appointments. Using the latest tools and techniques, we built and tested a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. We combined a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience.
